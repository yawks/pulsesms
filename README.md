## pulsesms

A golang API client for [Pulse SMS](https://home.pulsesms.app/overview/).

This library is currently very minimal. It only serves to receive new messages,
retrieve existing messages, and send messages into a conversation.

The main purpose of this library is to be used in a matrix bridge. Future
improvements may be made to extend the bridge functionality or become more
useful overall.


See [the example](./example/main.go) for how to use the client.
